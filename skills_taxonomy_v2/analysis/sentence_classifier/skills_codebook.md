# Defining Skills

We are using the European Commission's (ESCO) definition of [skills](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/skill) for this project. The Commission states that skills concepts fall within four categories: 1) knowledge; 2) skills; 3) attitudes and values and 4) langauge skills and knowledge.

A phrase or term that falls with any of the aforementioned categories should be considered a 'skill' and identified as such.

## Labelling Examples

### Examples of skills that fall within _knowledge_:

- knowledge of agriculture
- knowledge of particular policies
- knowledge of health and welfare

### Examples of skills that fall within _skills_:

- communication, collaboration and creativity
- handling and movng
- working with machinery
- assisting and caring

### Examples of skills that fall within _attitudes and values_:

- attention to detail
- make an effort
- work efficiently
- work independently

### Examples of skills that fall within _langauge skills and knowledge_:

- knowledge of another langauge

## Labelling Tips

In some cases the distinction between whether a sentence contains a skill or not will not be 100% clear. That's fine. Just use your best judgement. You can always use the Skip button (although it is best to try to make a decision). If a sentence certainly does not contain a skill, simply skip the task and move onto the next one.

Skill phrases or terms may not be written very similarly to how ESCO discuss skills. That's also okay and simply use your best judgement.

If you see that someone has already labelled a task via the annotation column not being 0, move onto the next task.

### Skills vs. Qualifications

- a degree or qualification requirement is not a skill! i.e. educated to MS level
